![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/dev.tunnicliff/lib-logging-android)

Logging that writes to a local database and manages permissions for uploading logs.
This library does not upload these logs anywhere, but can provide a delegate for sending logs
if allowed.
Local logs can be queried and provided to the user via app.

## Disclaimer

This project is open source and open to anyone to use as they see fit.
But I am building this with myself as the main target audience and I will not be expanding this
beyond my own needs.
If you want it to work differently, then fork and manage those changes yourself.
But if there are any bugs or suggestions you have for this project, feel free to reach out!
